<h2>MCP Tool Execution with User Confirmation</h2>
<p>
  The following describes a secure, governed BPMN process in Camunda 8 that allows an AI agent to use MCP tools (Model Context Protocol) only after explicit checks and, if necessary, user approval.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>A user submits a request, and the system decides whether an AI agent should be deployed</li>
  <li>The AI agent can use various MCP tools (e.g., DeepWiki, Time Conversions, Fetch URL, GitHub, Filesystem)</li>
  <li>For certain actions, an embedded MCP sub-process is started that checks whether the planned tool execution requires user confirmation</li>
  <li>If confirmation is required, the user is asked for approval and the answer is validated via a DMN decision table</li>
  <li>If execution is allowed, the AI agent performs the action using the respective MCP tool (e.g., Filesystem); otherwise the sub-process ends with “MCP execution not allowed”</li>
  <li>Finally, the user receives feedback or a complete summary of the results</li>
</ul>
